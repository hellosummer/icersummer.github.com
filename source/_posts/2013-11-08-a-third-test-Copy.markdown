不肯回顾传统的人,没有过去;不愿瞻望前景的人,没有未来。

The most welcomed people of the world are never those who continually look back upon the trials, the sorrows, the failures, the bitter frustrations of yesterday, but those who cast their eyes forward with faith, hope…courage, happy curiosity.
世界上最受欢迎的人从来不是那种不停地往后看着昨天的脚印、悲伤、失败和惨痛挫折的人,而是那种怀着信心、希望、勇气和愉快的求知欲而放眼未来的人。
